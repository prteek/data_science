It's much harder to create 'conciousness' because there are parts of conciousness that we don't understand, there are parts of which we don't know. We can create what we don't know, even if it is created somehow, we can't evaluate it for the same reason.  
### So we may have something which is like Hi res Audio. Something that is indistinguishable for human judgement but isn't really concious so to say.
