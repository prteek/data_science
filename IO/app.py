Similar to your other friendly neighbourhood costumed crusaders, I believe that "with great power comes great responsibility".  
So I rely on sound logic and principles of statistics, physics and math for designing and analysing stuff that matter.  
In the past I have worked with companies like:
* Suzuki
* Jaguar Land Rover
* Ford
* Allison Transmission
* Cloud Cycle 
* Bricklane

On problems ranging from track testing, Hybrid electric powertrain design, vehicle monitoring system, concrete quality degradation
and real estate behaviour modelling.

I have deep interest in Statistics, Machine learning and Python and I occasionally dabble in Astrophysics and Photography.
